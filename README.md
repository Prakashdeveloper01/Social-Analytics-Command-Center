# Social-Analytics-Command-Center
The Social Media Command Center is a 

complex program designed to monitor and analyze user 

activity on various social media platforms. The innovative 

tool includes sentiment analysis to measure user 

sentiment and sentiment. One of its main features is the 

ability to disable unwanted features, allowing you to 

access content and communications. The system uses 

sentiment analysis to identify and correct harmful or 

counterproductive user behavior to create a better and 

more manageable online environment. This allows the 

system to distinguish between positive, negative, and 

neutral emotions. The plug-in feature is a special feature 

of the Command Center that allows administrators to 

disable or block user actions based on arbitrary 

diagnostic results.
